## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- Added a public-surface check that blocks private project names and app-specific authorization hints from the public package.
- Added per-login allowlists for app-specific OIDC authorization parameters and public state UI context.
- Added Keycloak-compatible back-channel and front-channel logout handlers.
- Added Redis session indexes by user, OIDC `sid`, and legacy `session_state`.
- Added session listing and destroy primitives for current-user, all-user, `sid`, and `session_state` cleanup.
- Added OIDC client authentication method configuration for public and confidential clients.
- Added generic tenant, identity, permission, access, and API configuration surfaces for custom SaaS backend contracts.
- Added Vitest coverage for authorization parameters, access evaluation, permissions, tenant state, identity state, and API header configuration.
- Added React Router SaaS example app, installation docs, adapter docs, roadmap, maintainer notes, and Codex maintenance plan.
- Added an adapter request issue template for framework and provider integrations.

### Changed

- Switched server-side auth from direct `oauth4webapi` calls to `openid-client`.
- Removed built-in product-flow redirects from route protection; consuming apps now own all setup, billing, and tenant workflow routing through `configureRouteProtection`.
- Changed built-in package defaults from legacy project branding to Spine-oriented defaults.
- Made default logout RP-Initiated Logout and kept app-local cleanup explicit with `logout=local`.
- Removed `offline_access` from the default scope; apps can opt in explicitly if they need long-lived refresh tokens.
- Updated CI and release validation to run the full `pnpm check` gate.
